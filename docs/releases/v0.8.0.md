# Release Notes: v0.8.0

**Release Date:** 2026-01-25

## Highlights

This release simplifies the multi-agent-spec workflow with new `generate agents` and `generate all` commands, adds markdown command file support with YAML frontmatter, and introduces CLI dependency checking with human-in-the-loop prompts.

## New Features

### Simplified Agent Generation

The new `generate agents` command provides a streamlined workflow for generating platform-specific agents from multi-agent-spec definitions:

```bash
# Generate agents for a specific deployment target
assistantkit generate agents --spec=./specs --target=local --output=./plugins

# The command reads specs/deployments/{target}.json for target configuration
```

### Combined Generation Command

The `generate all` command combines plugins and agents generation in a single operation:

```bash
# Generate both plugins and agents
assistantkit generate all --spec=./spec --output=./plugins --platforms=claude,kiro
```

### Markdown Command Files

Commands can now be defined in markdown with YAML frontmatter, in addition to JSON:

```markdown
---
name: review-code
description: Reviews code for issues and improvements
allowed_tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
---

# Code Review Command

When reviewing code, follow these guidelines...
```

The system auto-detects the file format based on extension (`.md` vs `.json`).

### CLI Dependency Checking

The new `requirements` package provides human-in-the-loop dependency checking for CLI tools:

```go
import "github.com/agentplexus/assistantkit/requirements"

// Check requirements with interactive prompts
result := requirements.EnsureRequirements(
    []string{"go", "node", "docker"},
    requirements.NewCLIPrompter(),
)

if !result.AllSatisfied() {
    fmt.Println(requirements.FormatMissingError(result))
}
```

Features:

- Automatic detection of installed tools
- Platform-aware install method suggestions
- Interactive prompts for missing tool installation
- Registry of common development tools with install commands

## Security Improvements

- File write operations now use `0600` permissions instead of `0644` for better security

## Dependencies
